# adapted from rseng2D function distributed by  David BergstrÃ¶m (david.bergstrom@mysimlabs.com)
# =============================================================================
#     
# generates a square 2-dimensional random rough surface f(x,y) with NxN 
# surface points. The surface has a Gaussian height distribution function 
# and Gaussian autocovariance functions (in both x and y), where rL is the 
# length of the surface side, h is the RMS height and clx and cly are the 
# correlation lengths in x and y. Omitting cly makes the surface isotropic.
# 
# Input:    N   - number of surface points (along square side)
#           rL  - length of surface (along square side)
#           h   - rms height
#           clx, (cly)  - correlation lengths (in x and y)
# Output:   f  - surface heights
#           x  - surface points
#            y  - surface points
# =============================================================================

# =============================================================================
#      Nyquist sampling theorem sets a lower limit of the sample frequency of 
#       the surface to achieve the correct correlation length, see above (in 
#       this case the sampling frequency is referred to the sampling along 
#       one of the square sides of the surface). To achieve proper gaussian 
#       statistics in the 2D case use a ratio of surface length to correlation 
#       length rL/cl > ~70. Use the analysis code to check the quality of your 
#       surface and verify that you got what you asked for.
